Automatic gif generation for algorithms

usage:

`pip install manim`

`python -m manim run.py -p -ql`

The above doesn't work for some users because manim doesn't install ffmpeg. You can either `brew install ffmpeg` or `pip install ffmpeg`, but the former is more reliable in our experience. Then you should be able to run the second command, which is a very simple demo.
